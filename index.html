    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm an electronics technician and IT specialist. For many years I have been dealing with widely
        used electronic and computer technology. I develop my passion both in my professional life and in my hobby.
    </p>
    <p>
        For about four years I have also been involved in programming professionally.
        And in this direction I want to direct my future career.
        Therefore attend the course of <strong><a href="http://infoshareacademy.com/">InfoshareAcademy</a></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, I am going to gain competences as <strong>Junior Front-end Developer</strong>.
